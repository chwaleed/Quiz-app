## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Provider Integration:

```dart
// LeaderboardProvider
- loadGlobalLeaderboard()
- globalLeaderboard (getter)
- isLoadingGlobal (getter)
- globalError (getter)

// AuthProvider
- currentUser (for highlighting)
```

### State Management:

- Consumer pattern with `context.watch<T>()`
- Period filter state (selectedPeriod)
- Loading/error/empty state handling
- Pull-to-refresh capability

### Data Flow:

1. Screen loads → `loadGlobalLeaderboard()`
2. Provider fetches from DatabaseService
3. Data updates → UI rebuilds
4. User pulls to refresh → Reload with force flag

---
