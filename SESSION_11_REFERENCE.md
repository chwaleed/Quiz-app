## 💡 Tips for Success

### When Building Create/Edit Quiz:

1. **Use FormKey for validation:**

   ```dart
   final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();
   ```

2. **Use TextEditingControllers:**

   ```dart
   final _titleController = TextEditingController();
   ```

3. **Manage questions as a list:**

   ```dart
   List<Map<String, dynamic>> _questions = [];
   ```

4. **Add validation:**

   ```dart
   validator: (value) {
     if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
       return 'This field is required';
     }
     return null;
   }
   ```

5. **Show loading during save:**

   ```dart
   setState(() => _isLoading = true);
   ```

6. **Handle errors gracefully:**

   ```dart
   try {
     // Save quiz
   } catch (e) {
     ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
       SnackBar(content: Text('Error: $e')),
     );
   }
   ```

7. **Dispose controllers:**
   ```dart
   @override
   void dispose() {
     _titleController.dispose();
     super.dispose();
   }
   ```
